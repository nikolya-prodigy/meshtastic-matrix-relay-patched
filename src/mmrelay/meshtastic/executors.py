    Reset degraded state for executors, allowing recovery after reconnect.

    When executors reach the orphan threshold, they enter a degraded state

        When ble_address is provided (and reset_all is False), this function

    Reset the BLE worker executor when an address has reached the timeout threshold.

    best-effort cancellation and cleanup of a possibly stuck BLE task and resets the per-address
