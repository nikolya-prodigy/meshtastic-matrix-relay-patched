# Migration Guide for v1.3

This guide helps you upgrade from any legacy layout to the v1.3 unified HOME model.

## What Changed in 1.3

MMRelay now uses a single MMRELAY_HOME root for all runtime state:

> **Deprecation Note**: Legacy credential/location fallback is supported until v1.4; warnings will be emitted until you migrate. Plan to migrate before upgrading to v1.4.

- Credentials (moved to `matrix/` subdirectory)
- Database (moved to `database/` subdirectory)
- Logs (moved to `logs/` subdirectory)
- E2EE store (moved to `matrix/store/` subdirectory)
- Plugins (moved to `plugins/` subdirectory)

## New Directory Structure

After migration, your MMRELAY_HOME follows this layout:

```text
~/.mmrelay/  (or /data in containers)
├── config.yaml              # User configuration (optional, can be elsewhere)
├── matrix/                  # Matrix runtime artifacts
│   ├── credentials.json    # Matrix authentication credentials
│   └── store/              # E2EE encryption keys (Unix/macOS only)
├── database/
│   └── meshtastic.sqlite  # SQLite database (with -wal, -shm)
├── logs/
│   └── mmrelay.log          # Application logs
└── plugins/
    ├── core/              # Built-in plugins (read-only, in package)
    ├── custom/            # User plugins
    │   └── <plugin-name>/
    └── community/         # Third-party plugins
        └── <plugin-name>/
```

For containers, the canonical model remains:

- `MMRELAY_HOME=/data`
- Config mounted at `/data/config.yaml`

## Before Upgrading

1. Back up your current MMRELAY_HOME (or the location you use today for MMRelay data).
2. Ensure you can restore the backup.
3. Run a read-only preview: `mmrelay migrate --dry-run`.
4. If you are containerized, make sure you have a single persistent root.

### Credentials Compatibility Notes

- v1.3 can migrate legacy credentials from:
  - `MMRELAY_HOME/credentials.json` (expected legacy location)
  - `~/credentials.json` (legacy fallback; only when file looks like valid Matrix credentials)
- For safety, home-root fallback migration validates required keys before moving files:
  - `homeserver`
  - `access_token`

`user_id` is optional in v1.3+ and can be recovered at runtime when needed.
If your credentials are missing or malformed, run `mmrelay auth login` again to regenerate.

## Upgrade Steps (All Deployments)

1. Stop MMRelay.
2. Upgrade the package or container image to 1.3.
3. Run `mmrelay migrate` to move legacy data into MMRELAY_HOME.
4. Start MMRelay.

Migration in v1.3 uses **move semantics** by default: legacy files are moved to the new structure and removed from their original locations to prevent duplicates.

To ensure safety and atomicity, the migration process follows a **staged move pattern**:

1. Each unit (config, credentials, etc.) is first moved to a temporary staging directory (`MMRELAY_HOME/.migration_staging/`).
2. The staged data is validated for integrity.
3. Upon successful validation, the unit is atomically renamed to its final destination in `MMRELAY_HOME`.

If a destination file already exists, a timestamped backup is **always** created before it is overwritten. These backups are stored in a dedicated directory: `MMRELAY_HOME/.migration_backups/`.

If you need to overwrite existing target files, use `mmrelay migrate --force`. Note that even with `--force`, safety backups of your existing destination data are still created.

## Deployment-Specific Migration Quick Reference

### Local / systemd / venv / pipx installs

1. Upgrade package to 1.3.0.
2. Run:
   - `mmrelay migrate --dry-run`
   - `mmrelay migrate`
   - `mmrelay verify-migration`

### Docker Compose installs

See [Docker-Specific Notes](#docker-specific-notes) for detailed instructions.

### Windows Installer / pip installs

See [Windows-Specific Notes](#windows-specific-notes) for detailed instructions.

### Kubernetes / Helm installs

See [Kubernetes-Specific Notes](#kubernetes-specific-notes) for detailed instructions.

### Migration Command Flags

- `--dry-run`: Preview migration actions without changing files. Recommended before applying changes.
- `--move`: Move source files to `MMRELAY_HOME` instead of copying (this is the default behavior). Ignored when combined with `--dry-run`. Backups are still created before any overwrites.
- `--force`: Allow overwriting existing files in `MMRELAY_HOME` (backups are still created). Use only after verifying your backups.

> **Note**: Migration uses **move semantics by default** — source files are moved to the new location rather than copied. The `--move` flag is provided for explicitness but is not required since this is the default behavior. This prevents duplicate data and keeps the migration clean. Backups are always created before any overwrites.

## Docker-Specific Notes

1. Update compose to 1.3 model:
   - `MMRELAY_HOME=/data`
   - Use a single bind mount or volume at `/data`
   - config mounted at `/data/config.yaml`
   - reference examples:
     - prebuilt image (recommended): [`src/mmrelay/tools/sample-docker-compose-prebuilt.yaml`](../src/mmrelay/tools/sample-docker-compose-prebuilt.yaml)
     - build from source override: [`src/mmrelay/tools/sample-docker-compose-override.yaml`](../src/mmrelay/tools/sample-docker-compose-override.yaml)
     - environment template: [`src/mmrelay/tools/sample.env`](../src/mmrelay/tools/sample.env)
2. Ensure `.env` host path values are valid absolute paths.
3. Run migration inside container:
   - `docker compose exec mmrelay mmrelay migrate --dry-run`
   - `docker compose exec mmrelay mmrelay migrate`
   - `docker compose exec mmrelay mmrelay verify-migration`

If your deployment runs the app container as non-root and migration reports permission errors,
run one-off migration commands as root:

```bash
docker run --rm --user root \
  -v ${HOME}/.mmrelay:/data \
  -v ${HOME}/config.yaml:/data/config.yaml:ro \
  ghcr.io/jeremiah-k/mmrelay:<tag> \
  mmrelay migrate
```

After root-run migration, restore ownership on host files so normal runtime (non-root) can read/write:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.mmrelay
```

If verification fails, stop the container, restore your backup, and roll back to the previous image.

## Windows-Specific Notes

### Windows Installer Behavior

The Windows installer uses the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\MM Relay\`) as the MMRELAY_HOME. All batch files created by the installer use `--home` to ensure consistent data locations:

- `mmrelay.bat` - Runs MMRelay with all data in the install directory
- `setup-auth.bat` - Sets up Matrix authentication
- `logout.bat` - Logs out from Matrix

### Default Paths Without Installer

If you installed via pip/pipx instead of the Windows installer, the default HOME location is:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\mmrelay\
├── config.yaml
├── matrix\
│   └── credentials.json
├── database\
│   └── meshtastic.sqlite
├── logs\
└── plugins\
```

### Upgrading on Windows

1. **If using the Windows installer:**
   - Download and run the new installer
   - Your existing data in the install directory will be preserved
   - No migration is needed if all data was already in the install directory

2. **If upgrading from pip/pipx with data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mmrelay`:**
   - Install the new version
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Run migration to verify and move any legacy data:

   ```cmd
   mmrelay migrate --dry-run
   mmrelay migrate
   mmrelay verify-migration
   ```

3. **If you have data in both locations:**
   - The migration tool will detect this as a "split roots" condition
   - Review the output carefully before proceeding
   - Use `--dry-run` first to preview changes

### Windows-Specific Limitations

- **E2EE not supported**: Matrix End-to-End Encryption is not available on Windows due to library limitations. The `matrix/store/` directory is not created on Windows.
- **File-in-use errors**: Migration includes retry logic for Windows file locks (antivirus, Windows Indexer), but may still fail if files are actively in use. Close MMRelay before running migration.

## Kubernetes-Specific Notes

1. Keep one PVC mounted at `/data`.
2. Keep config mounted at `/data/config.yaml`.
3. Deploy upgraded manifests/chart and verify in pod:
   - `kubectl exec -n mmrelay <pod> -- mmrelay migrate --dry-run`
   - `kubectl exec -n mmrelay <pod> -- mmrelay migrate`
   - `kubectl exec -n mmrelay <pod> -- mmrelay verify-migration`

If verification fails, stop the rollout and restore your previous image and backup.

## After Upgrading

1. Run `mmrelay verify-migration` (read-only) to confirm the unified layout.
2. If verification fails, keep MMRelay stopped until you resolve the warnings.

## How to Verify Success

Use the verification command:

```bash
mmrelay verify-migration
```

This command:

- Prints the resolved MMRELAY_HOME
- Lists credentials, database, E2EE store, and logs paths
- Includes plugins and database directory checks
- Detects legacy data outside MMRELAY_HOME

Exit code semantics:

- `0`: Unified-home is clean (no legacy data, no split roots, credentials present)
- non-zero: Stop and fix before running live (missing credentials or legacy data present)

### Diagnostic Commands

Two commands are available for checking your installation:

| Command                    | Purpose                                 | Exit Codes                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mmrelay verify-migration` | Migration validation for CI/CD          | 0=pass, 1=fail                                  |
| `mmrelay doctor`           | General diagnostics for troubleshooting | 0=always (informational, do not script against) |

**When to use each:**

- **`verify-migration`**: Use in CI/CD pipelines and after migration to confirm the system is ready. Returns non-zero exit code if action is needed.
- **`doctor`**: Use when troubleshooting path issues or checking system health. Shows additional info like environment variables, disk space, E2EE dependencies, and database health. Always returns 0 (informational only) — do not script against this command's exit code for automation.

### Legacy Layout Detection in HOME

When upgrading from v1.2, the `mmrelay doctor` command might detect v1.2 layout artifacts still within your HOME directory:

```text
📂 Legacy Layout in HOME (v1.2):
   ⚠️  credentials: ~/.mmrelay/credentials.json
   ⚠️  e2ee_store: ~/.mmrelay/store
```

This occurs when files are in the v1.2 locations (HOME root) instead of the v1.3 locations (`matrix/` subdirectory):

| v1.2 Location                 | v1.3 Location                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `~/.mmrelay/credentials.json` | `~/.mmrelay/matrix/credentials.json` |
| `~/.mmrelay/store/`           | `~/.mmrelay/matrix/store/`           |

These items will be automatically moved to the correct locations when you run `mmrelay migrate`. No manual action is required.

## How to Roll Back Safely (Manual)

If you need to manually undo a successful migration:

1. Stop MMRelay.
2. Restore your manual backup to the pre-upgrade location.
3. Downgrade the package or container image.
4. Start MMRelay.
5. Confirm the service starts and data is intact.
