    ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` deliberately uses non-daemon workers and CPython waits
    for those workers during interpreter shutdown. That is desirable for normal
    jobs, but not for best-effort BLE calls into BlueZ/DBus that can wedge below
    Python and never return. This executor keeps the familiar ``Future`` API while
    ensuring a stuck worker cannot prevent the relay process from exiting.

    The implementation intentionally uses only public ``concurrent.futures``
    primitives so it does not depend on private CPython thread-pool internals.
