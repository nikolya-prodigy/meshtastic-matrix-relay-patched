# What's New in 1.3.0

MMRelay 1.3.0 introduces a unified runtime directory structure and streamlined migration tools.

## Changes

- **Unified runtime path model** (`MMRELAY_HOME`) across local, Docker, and Kubernetes deployments
- **New migration commands** for safe data migration:
  - `mmrelay migrate --dry-run` - Preview migration without changes
  - `mmrelay migrate` - Apply migration
  - `mmrelay verify-migration` - Validate migration (CI/CD friendly)
  - `mmrelay doctor` - System diagnostics and troubleshooting
- **Simplified directory structure**: All runtime data (credentials, database, logs, plugins, E2EE store) organized under a single home directory
- **Move-only migration** for safety and simplicity
- **Updated deployment documentation** for the 1.3 path behavior
- **Improved E2EE dependency troubleshooting**

## Migration

If upgrading from v1.2 or earlier, see the **[Migration Guide](MIGRATION_1.3.md)** for detailed instructions.
