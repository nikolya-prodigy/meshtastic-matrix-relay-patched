    Route an incoming Meshtastic packet to configured Matrix rooms or installed plugins based on runtime configuration.

    Processes the decoded packet and, depending on interaction settings and packet contents, will relay emoji reactions and replies to mapped Matrix events, dispatch ordinary text messages to Matrix rooms mapped to the packet's channel (unless the message is a direct message to the relay node or handled by a plugin), and hand non-text or unhandled packets to installed plugins with a per-plugin timeout.

    Parameters:
        packet (dict): Decoded Meshtastic packet. Expected keys include:
            - 'decoded' (dict): may contain 'text', 'replyId', 'portnum', and optional 'emoji'

            - 'id' (packet id)
            - optional 'channel' (mapped channel value)
        interface: Meshtastic interface used to resolve node information and the relay node id. Must provide .myInfo.my_node_num and a .nodes mapping for sender metadata.
